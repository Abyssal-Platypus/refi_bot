Alright so this is the current iteration of the Refi bot. There's not much changed from the wiggle bot, but there are a couple of new files. One is the Procfile, and the other is requirements.txt. Side note settings.json just changes the format for using VSCode.
So to give a quick rundown, the Procfile and requirements files are needed for hosting online. I set up the bot using Heroku which is free for running bots. There is an hour cap that gets extended if you confirm a credit card but that option is up to you. The easiest way to set up the bot is to set up a Heroku account, set up an "app" for the bot to be uploaded to (similar to a git repo), download the Heroku CLI and a git. Once you download and install you are able to upload to your Heroku repo and deploy your bot from your CMD. I can provide a video tutorial link if needed. 
The most important part is establishing your Procfile and requirements.txt. The Procfile will establish your bot as a worker in the current set up. Worker defines it as a bot, python is the dedicated language and the last part is the file name. Secondly the requirements.txt will establish the required modules for your program. Since this is in Python you need to list the needed Python modules and their current iterations. If the module is a GitHub based module you will need to use the "git+" signifier to dictate that it is downloaded from GitHub. The bot will run on a virtual computer, the computer uses a virtual pip installer to download the needed modules. Your bot will not run if the modules are not correct. Couple of extra things, if your bot pulls from other files to complete functions or pull info as long as the files are included with the upload you don't need to worry. Also if you used json that also doesn't need to be signified. I hope this helps, if you have any questions feel free to ask me.
